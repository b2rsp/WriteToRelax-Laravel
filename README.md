#  For this project i will be using Laravel 5 

This is APP where i am going to develop my webdevelopment skills, is not production ready or or should be taken serioulsy!!
Is just a project where i will try diferent tecnologies and stuff.

Some of my goals are with this project is

* Do a demo using Laravel as is.
* Reply the demo spliting the backend (API) and frontend
* Frontend: Learn Angular JS 2
* Frontend: Learn React
* Frontend: Lean Vue.js 2
* Backend: Redo the API with Go
* Backend: Redo with MeteorJS
* Backend: Redo with Node.jS (Sails or koa)
* Backend: Redo with Closure
* Backend: Redo with Erlang


The idea of the project is quinte simple:
Is a text editor where the user simple start to right everything that comes to it's min withou caring about edition or something.
It has the same purpose of some types of medidation, which is to allow the toughts to flow as it is without juding them. But by writing them is simpler to achieve that same purpose and its a little more entertaining for some people.
The only catch is the user must write at least 1000 words and whenever it reaches its goal it will be marked as sucessfull day.
